Fast Learner. I am a curious, persistent and thoughtful person. 

I have a long term vision regarding the web3, and strongly believe that blockchain technology will reshape the global economy. 

Passionate about investments and cryptocurrencies, I keep a daily information watch to stay informed of all the events. 

Thanks to my professional experiences and my field of study, I have been able to develop adequate skills to work in finance and in the world of crypto assets.
